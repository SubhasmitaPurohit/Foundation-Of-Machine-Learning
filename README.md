# Foundation-Of-Machine-Learning
Guided by Dr. Anush Sankaran
1.Building a ML mindset
As per my understanding AI is a combination of Learning and Understanding of algorithm. And Algorithm is a logic to which used to complete or solve any query. ML is a subset of AI and DL (Deep learning) is a subset of ML.
2.What is ML?
Classifying any object based on one or more standard features where effect of generalisation is least.
Features Extraction is “HOW TO REPRESENT DATA POINTS” and classification is “CLASSIFY THE OBJECT IN TO DIFFERENT CLASSES BASED ON THE FEATURES” .
3.Pipeline of ML
I.	Define a problem-Articulate a problem
II.	Collect data-Look for labelled data
III.	Clean and process data-Design data s per requirement 
IV.	Extract Features- Based on problem which are the standard features 
V.	Learn to perform Task-check the Output
VI.	Predict Output
4. Types of ML algorithm
I.	Supervised Learning
a)	Classification
b)	Regression 
II.	Unsupervised Learning
a)	Dimension Reduction
b)	Clustering
III.	Reinforcement Learning
In ML we used Natural Science for running any experiment and Statistical analysis instead of logic to analyse the output.
5.Different example where we used ML in day to day life 
i.	Post anything (Text, Pictures, Video) in Social media
i.e. If we search any person or location or any product or any channel in FB, it shows the exact and also relevant result based on search. 
HOW ML works: Fb collect each and every data we post on their platform and use against our search. Its shows the most demanded person/location /any result as per the search.
ii.	Reading Comprehension 
 In Reading Comprehension what exactly happen, a paragraph is given to us and below that some question given from the paragraph and we have to find the answer from the same paragraph. This logic is same for every paragraph so what ML do, its stored the location of the answer even it understand what exactly the answer should be. 
iii.	House Rental app
Let’s take an example of house rental app Magic bricks. As per our requirement we put some filter and we can saw exact result. Here the Features Engineer or the data scientist never put data as we filter but from the features of the data they are classified as per our filter and sort
Below the data set is random and only for Bangalore location and for understanding purpose.
Location	BHK	Rental	Prefer by
Sarjapura signal	3	18000	Family
Wipro Corporate office	2	10000	Bachelors
Domasanndra 	4	25000	Family
Sarjapura	1	8000	Bachelors
Location, BHK and rents are the features and preferred by is the class from here we can easily visualize the data which  pattern by one single line .
